# ARX Project Status

## Current State: FRESH START
- **Status**: Starting from scratch with clean architecture
- **Previous Version**: Archived in `archive/` folder
- **Active Development**: Root directory only

## Archive Policy
- `archive/` contains OLD VERSION for reference only
- **DO NOT** copy code from archive to current project
- **DO NOT** use archive as starting point for new features
- Archive is maintained for historical context only

## Development Approach
1. **Fresh Implementation**: Start clean, don't copy old code
2. **Modern Architecture**: Use current best practices
3. **Documentation First**: Document before implementing
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before features
5. **Clean Code**: Follow established patterns

## What's Different
- Cleaner architecture
- Better separation of concerns
- Modern C practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper testing framework

## Getting Started
1. Read `docs/` for current architecture
2. Follow `docs/development/` guidelines
3. **Ignore** `archive/` for active development
4. Use `archive/` only for understanding historical context
